## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 70%, 45% (Hex: #297ACC), a confident, reassuring blue to represent the reliability and security of the onboarding process.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (Hex: #F0F4F7), a very light desaturated blue to keep the interface clean and unobtrusive.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 65%, 40% (Hex: #1AB2B2), a vibrant teal to highlight key interactive elements and notifications.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring a balance of modernity and readability. Space Grotesk captures the cutting edge feel of HR tech, and Inter will remain easy on the eyes in any longer form content.
- Use clear, professional icons from a consistent set, emphasizing simplicity and ease of understanding.
- Clean, intuitive layout with clear sections for each part of the onboarding process. Use of white space to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smoother user experience, like slide-in effects and progress bar updates.
